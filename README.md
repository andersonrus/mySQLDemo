# mySQLDemo
This code and tutorial (javaSQL.pdf) is part of the Java course taught through Computer Careers,  South Central College in North Mankato 56003 USA.

<strong>This tutorial demonstrates the most common SQL statements using Java.</strong>

You will learn how to:
<ul>
<li>CREATE TABLE - Create an new, empty table</li>
<li>INSERT a new record of data into a table</li>
<li>SELECT a set of data from a table</li>
<li>UPDATE any record in a table</li>
<li>DELETE a record from a table</li>
<li>DROP (delete) a table</li>
</ul>

These make up the most common SQL functions summarized with the acronym, CRUD:
<ul>
<li>Create - INSERT</li>
<li>Read - SELECT</li>
<li>Update - UPDATE</li>
<li>Delete - DELETE</li>
</ul>

Youâ€™ll also become familiar with some of the Java methods from the DriveManager and Statement classes that allow you to do the heavy lifting.
