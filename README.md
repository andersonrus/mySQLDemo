# mySQLDemo
This code and tutorial (javaSQL.pdf) is part of the Java course taught through Computer Careers,  South Central College in North Mankato 56003 USA.

This tutorial demonstrates the most common SQL statements using Java.

You will learn how to:
• CREATE TABLE - Create an new, empty table.
• INSERT a new record of data into a table.
• SELECT a set of data from a table.
• UPDATE any record in a table.
• DELETE a record from a table.
• DROP (delete) a table.

These make up the most common SQL functions summarized with the acronym, CRUD:
• Create - INSERT
• Read - SELECT
• Update - UPDATE
• Delete - DELETE

You’ll also become familiar with some of the Java methods from the DriveManager and Statement classes that allow you to do the heavy lifting.
